Not Content:
- Update readme
- Figure out the alignment of the header, looks like a pixel too far to the right, also make the title farther than the nativation from my name
- Make it so that only authorized users can update the database. 
- something about the base href is wrong, make it so that daniel-harmon.com isn't a url extension for everything.

Ideas:
- maybe change url extension to blog name instead of id?

- search feature for if it gets long?
